# Path Scripts

Just a collection of scripts I find useful to have on the system path. Things 
in here should generally run on unixes and windows with cygwin.

## Descriptions
* **vim2html** One liner, produces the html of how vim syntax highlights the input
* **sorttv.py** For organizing downloaded TV shows
